# DDD Architecture Diagrams

This repository contains all the PlantUML diagrams related to the Domain Driven Design (DDD) architecture. These diagrams help to visualize the structure and relationships of various components in a DDD-based system, and provide a clear understanding of how the system works.

# PlantUML Diagrams

The following are the PlantUML diagrams available in this repository:

Core Principles of DDD.puml: A diagram that outlines the core principles of Domain Driven Design.

DDD Sequence Diagram.puml: A sequence diagram that illustrates the flow of events in a DDD-based system.

DDD-based class diagram.puml: A class diagram that shows the classes and their relationships in a DDD-based system.

DDD-Based Deployment Diagram.puml: A deployment diagram that depicts the physical infrastructure of a DDD-based system.

DDD-Based System Architecture.puml: An architecture diagram that provides an overview of the different components in a DDD-based system.

DDD-component-diagram.puml: A component diagram that displays the components and their relationships in a DDD-based system.

DDD-ERD.puml: An entity-relationship diagram that illustrates the relationships between entities in a DDD-based system.

DDD-Use-Case-Diagram.puml: A use case diagram that shows the different use cases and actors in a DDD-based system.

DevOps and DDD.puml: A diagram that highlights the relationship between DevOps and DDD.

Establish Clear Boundaries Between Domains.puml: A diagram that illustrates the importance of establishing clear boundaries between domains in a DDD-based system.

Excessive Complexity.puml: A diagram that warns against the dangers of excessive complexity in a DDD-based system.

Identify Domain Experts.puml: A diagram that emphasizes the importance of identifying domain experts in a DDD-based system.

Improved Code Organization.puml: A diagram that shows how DDD can lead to improved code organization in a system.

When DDD May Be Appropriate.puml: A diagram that outlines the scenarios when DDD may be an appropriate approach for system design.
